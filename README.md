# AAXtoMP3
The purpose of this software is to convert AAX or AAXC files to common MP3, M4A, M4B, flac and ogg formats
through a basic bash script frontend to FFMPEG.

Audible uses the AAX file format to maintain DRM restrictions on their audio
books and if you download your book through your library it will be
stored in this format.

The purpose of this software is **not** to circumvent the DRM restrictions
for audio books that **you** do not own in that you do not have them on
your **personal** Audible account. The purpose of this software is to
create a method for you to download and store your books just in case
Audible fails for some reason.

Forked by kcrvM4 from [KrumpetPirate/AAXtoMP3](https://github.com/KrumpetPirate/AAXtoMP3) with minor bug fixes and enhancements.

## Features
* Converts `.aax`/`.aaxc` to single (-s) or chaptered (-c) `.m4a`/`.m4b` with `-a` or `-e:m4a/-e:m4b`.
* Embeds cover art using `mp4art` and chapters using `mp4chaps` for `.m4a/.m4b`.
* Supports `--use-audible-cli-data` for JSON-based chapters and annotations.
* Sanitizes directory and file names (replaces /, \, *, <, >, |, ?, " with _, : with ' -', ; with ,, removes .).
* Cleans up `cover.jpg` and `.chapters.txt` post-conversion if embedded (can be disabled with **--no-cleanup** option).
* Copies `-annotations.json` and generates a `.csv` file (with `Type`, `Start Time`, `End Time`, `Note` headers) to output directory.

## Requirements
* `bash` 3.2.57 or later tested
* `ffmpeg` version 2.8.3 or later (4.4 or later if the input file is `.aaxc`)
* `libmp3lame` (typically 'lame' in your system's package manager)
* `grep`, `sed`, `find` (GNU versions; macOS/BSD users may need to install via package manager)
* `jq` - only required if `--use-audible-cli-data` is set or if converting an `.aaxc` file
* `bc` (for bitrate calculations)
* `mp4v2` (provides both mp4art and mp4chaps) (OPTIONAL)
  * `mp4art` used to add cover art to `.m4a` and `.m4b` files. (OPTIONAL)
  * `mp4chaps` used to add chapters to `.m4a` and `.m4b` files. (OPTIONAL)
* `mediainfo` used to add additional media tags like narrator. (OPTIONAL)

## Conversion Suggestions
### Choosing Your Output Format
Choose your output format carefully to save time and space (and avoid redoing your library later)! While `.mp3` is the default, `.m4a` or `.m4b` (via `-a`, `-e:m4a`, or `-e:m4b`) support embedded cover art and chapters, enhancing the listening experience. AAC is also 20-30x faster than MP3 due to no transcoding and has similar file size at the same quality level.

### Preserving Annotations
Donâ€™t lose your notes and bookmarks! The `-annotations.json` file stores these and can be downloaded using `audible-cli` with the `--annotation` flag. When `--use-audible-cli-data` is enabled, the script copies `<title>-annotations.json` to the output directory and generates `<title>_annotations.csv` with headers `Type`, `Start Time`, `End Time`, `Note`. While not embedded in the audiobook, you can easily view your annotations or import them into compatible players.

## Usage
```
AAXtoMP3 [OPTION_1] [OPTION_2]... <AAX/AAXC_INPUT_FILE_1> <AAX/AAXC_INPUT_FILE_2>...
```

### Interactive Guide
This will guide you through the options.
```
interactiveAAXtoMP3 [-a|--advanced] [-h|--help]
```

### Batch conversion
To convert multiple .aax/.aaxc files, ensure that all files to be converted are placed in the same folder and use *.aax or *.aaxc for <AAX/AAXC_INPUT_FILE>.

```
AAXtoMP3 -a --use-audible-cli-data -t <PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FOLDER> <PATH_TO_INPUT_FOLDER>/*.aaxc > <PATH_TO_LOG_FOLDER>/conversion_log.txt 2>&1
```

#### Example
```
AAXtoMP3 -a --use-audible-cli-data -t ~/Downloads/Output ~/Downloads/Input/*.aaxc > ~/Downloads/conversion_log.txt 2>&1
```

Note: "**> ~/Downloads/conversion_log.txt 2>&1$**" is optional and will write the output to a text file for easy review after conversion.

## Options for AAXtoMP3
* **-f** or **--flac**   Flac Encoding and as default produces a single file.
* **-o** or **--opus**   Ogg/Opus Encoding defaults to multiple file output by chapter. The extension is .ogg
* **-a** or **--aac**    AAC Encoding and produce a single m4a file output.
* **-A** or **--authcode &lt;AUTHCODE&gt;** for this execution of the command use the provided &lt;AUTHCODE&gt; to decode the AAX file. Not needed if the source file is .aaxc.
* **-N** or **--no-cleanup**  Leaves cover.jpg and/or chapter.txt files in output directory after successful embedding.* **-n** or * **-n** or **--no-cleanup** If set and the target directory already exists, AAXtoMP3 will exit without overwriting anything.
* **-t** or **--target_dir &lt;PATH&gt;** change the default output location to the named &lt;PATH&gt;. Note the default location is ./Audiobook of the directory to which each AAX file resides.
* **-C** or **--complete_dir &lt;PATH&gt;** a directory to place aax files after they have been decoded successfully. Note make a back up of your aax files prior to using this option. Just in case something goes wrong.
* **-V** or **--validate** Perform 2 validation tests on the supplied aax files. This is more extensive than the normal validation as we attempt to transcode the aax file to a null file.  This can take a long period of time. However it is useful when inspecting a large set of aax files prior to transcoding. As download errors are common with Audible servers.
* **-e:mp3**         Identical to defaults.
* **-e:m4a**         Create a m4a audio file. This is identical to --aac
* **-e:m4b**         Create a m4b audio file. This is the book version of the m4a format.
* **-s** or **--single**    Output a single file for the entire book. If you only want a single ogg file for instance.
* **-c** or **--chaptered** Output a single file per chapter. The `--chaptered` option will only work if it follows the `--aac -e:m4a -e:m4b --flac` options, as chaptered is already the default mode for `mp3` and `ogg` files.
* **--continue &lt;CHAPTERNUMBER&gt;**      If the splitting into chapters gets interrupted (e.g. by a weak battery on your laptop) you can go on where the process got interrupted. Just delete the last chapter (which was incompletely generated) and redo the task with "--continue &lt;CHAPTERNUMBER&gt;" where CHAPTERNUMBER is the chapter that got interrupted.
* **--level &lt;COMPRESSIONLEVEL&gt;**      Set compression level. May be given for mp3, flac and opus.
* **--keep-author &lt;FIELD&gt;**           If a book has multiple authors and you don't want all of them in the metadata, with this flag you can specify a specific author (1 is the first, 2 is the second...) to keep while discarding the others.
* **--author &lt;AUTHOR&gt;**               Manually set the author metadata field, useful if you have multiple books of the same author but the name reported is different (e.g., spacing, accents..). Has precedence over `--keep-author`.
* **-l** or **--loglevel &lt;LOGLEVEL&gt;** Set loglevel: 0 = progress only, 1 (default) = more information, output of chapter splitting progress is limited to a progress bar, 2 = more information, especially on chapter splitting, 3 = debug mode
* **-D** or **--dir-naming-scheme &lt;STRING&gt;**     Use a custom directory naming scheme, with variables. See [below](#custom-naming-scheme) for more info.
* **-F** or **--file-naming-scheme &lt;STRING&gt;**    Use a custom file naming scheme, with variables. See [below](#custom-naming-scheme) for more info.
* **--chapter-naming-scheme &lt;STRING&gt;**  Use a custom chapter naming scheme, with variables. See [below](#custom-naming-scheme) for more info.
* **--use-audible-cli-data** Use additional data got with mkb79/audible-cli. See [below](#audible-cli-integration) for more info. Needed for the files in the `.aaxc` format (turned on by default for `.aaxc` files).
* **-L** or **--audible-cli-library-file** Path of the library-file, generated by mkb79/audible-cli (`audible library export -o ./library.tsv`). Only available if `--use-audible-cli-data` is set. This file is required to parse additional metadata such as `$series` or `$series_sequence`.
* **--ffmpeg-path**  Set the ffmpeg/ffprobe binaries folder. Both of them must be executable and in the same folder.
* **--ffmpeg-name**  Set a custom name for the ffmpeg binary. Must be executable and in path, or in custom path specified by --ffmpeg-path.
* **--ffprobe-name**  Set a custom name for the ffprobe binary. Must be executable and in path, or in custom path specified by --ffmpeg-path.

### Options for interactiveAAXtoMP3
* **-a** or **--advanced** Get more options to choose. Not used right now.
* **-h** or **--help** Get a help prompt.
This script presents you the options you chose last time as default.
When you get asked for the aax-file you may just drag'n'drop it to the terminal.

### AUTHCODE
**Your** Audible auth code (it won't correctly decode otherwise). Not required to decode the `aaxc` format.

#### Determining your own AUTHCODE
You will need your authentication code that comes from Audible's servers. This 
will be used by ffmpeg to perform the initial audio convert. You can obtain 
this string from a tool like 
[audible-activator](https://github.com/inAudible-NG/audible-activator) or like [audible-cli](https://github.com/mkb79/audible-cli).
* [audible-cli](https://github.com/mkb79/audible-cli) command to obtain the authentication code for .aax files: `audible activation-bytes`

#### Specifying the AUTHCODE.
In order of __precedence__.
1. __--authcode [AUTHCODE]__ The command line option. With the highest precedence.
2. __.authcode__ If this file is placed in the current working directory and contains only the authcode it is used if the above is not.
3. __~/.authcode__ a global config file for all the tools. And is used as the default if none of the above are specified.
__Note:__ At least one of the above must be exist if converting `aax` files. The code must also match the encoding for the user that owns the AAX file(s). If the authcode does not match the AAX file no transcoding will occur.

### MP3 Encoding
* This is the **default** encoding
* Produces 1 or more mp3 files for the AAX title.
* The default mode is **chaptered**
* If you want an mp3 file for each chapter, do not use the **--single** option. 
* A m3u playlist file will also be created when using the **--chaptered** option.
* **--level** has to be in range 0-9, where 9 is fastest and 0 is highest quality. Please note: The quality can **never** become higher than the quality of the original aax file!

### Ogg/Opus Encoding
* Can be done by using the **-o** or **--opus** command line switches
* The default mode is **chaptered**
* Opus coded files are stored in the ogg container format for better compatibility.
* **--level** has to be in range 0-10, where 0 is fastest and 10 is highest quality. Please note: The quality can **never** become higher than the quality of the original aax file!

### AAC Encoding
* Can be done by using the **-a** or **--aac** command line switches
* The default mode is **single**
* Designed to be the successor of the MP3 format
* Generally achieves better sound quality than MP3 at the same bit rate.
* This will only produce 1 audio file as output.

### FLAC Encoding
* Can be done by using the **-f** or **--flac** command line switches
* The default mode is **single**
* FLAC is an open format with royalty-free licensing
* This will only produce 1 audio file as output. If you want a flac file per chapter do use **-c** or **--chaptered**.
* **--level** has to be in range 0-12, where 0 is fastest and 12 is highest compression. Since flac is lossless, the quality always remains the same.

### M4A and M4B Containers
* These containers were created by Apple Inc. They were meant to be the successor to mp3.
* M4A is a container that is meant to hold music and is typically of a higher bitrate.
* M4B is a container that is meant to hold audiobooks and is typically has bitrates of 64k and 32k.
* Both formats support embedded chapters
* Both formats support embedded cover art
* The default mode is **single**

### Validating AAX files
* The **--validate** option will result in only a validation pass over the supplied aax file(s). No transcoding will occur. This is useful when you wish to ensure you have a proper download of your personal Audible audio books. With this option all supplied books are validated.
* If you do NOT supply the **--validate** option all audio books are still validated when they are processed. However if there is an invalid audio book in the supplied list of books the processing will stop at that point.
* A third test is performed on the file where the entire file is inspected to see if it is valid. This is a lengthy process. However it will not break the script when an invalid file is found.
* The 3 tests currently are:
    1. aax present
    2. meta data header in file is valid and complete
    3. entire file is valid and complete.  _only executed with the **--validate** option._

### Defaults
* Default output directory is the base directory of each file listed, then `/<GENRE>/<AUTHOR>/<TITLE>` directory tree structure.
* The default codec is mp3
* The default output is one file per chapter.

### Custom naming scheme
The following flags can modify the default naming scheme:
* **-D** or **--dir-naming-scheme**  
* **-F** or **--file-naming-scheme**
* **--chapter-naming-scheme** 

Each flag takes a string as argument. If the string contains a variable defined in the script (eg. artist, title, chapter, narrator...), the corresponding value is used.
The default options correspond to the following flags:
* `--dir-naming-scheme '$genre/$artist/$title'`
* `--file-naming-scheme '$title'`
* `--chapter-naming-scheme '$title-$(printf %0${#chaptercount}d $chapternum) $chapter'`

Additional notes:
* If a command substitution is present in the passed string, (for example `$(printf %0${#chaptercount}d $chapternum)`, used to pad with zeros the chapter number), the commands are executed.
So you can use `--dir-naming-scheme '$(date +%Y)/$artist'`, but using `--file-naming-scheme '$(rm -rf /)'` is a really bad idea. Be careful.
* You can use basic text, like `--dir-naming-scheme 'Converted/$title'`
* You can also use shell variables as long as you escape them properly: `CustomGenre=Horror ./AAXtoMP3 --dir-naming-scheme "$CustomGenre/\$artist/\$title" *.aax`
* If you want shorter chapter names, use `--chapter-naming-scheme '$(printf %0${#chaptercount}d $chapternum) $chapter'`: only chapter number and chapter name
* If you want to append the narrator name to the title, use `--dir-naming-scheme '$genre/$artist/$title-$narrator' --file-naming-scheme '$title-$narrator'`
* If you don't want to have the books separated by author, use `--dir-naming-scheme '$genre/$title'`
* To be able to use `$series` or `$series_sequence` in the schemes the following is required:
  * `--use-audible-cli-data` is set
  * you have pre-generated the library-file via `audible library export -o ./library.tsv`
  * you have set the path to the generated library-file via `--audible-cli-library-file ./library.tsv`

### Installing Dependencies.
In general, take a look at [command-not-found.com](https://command-not-found.com/)

#### FFMPEG,FFPROBE
__Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian__
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg x264 x265 bc jq
```

In Debian-based system's repositories the ffmpeg version is often outdated. If you want
to convert .aaxc files, you need at least ffmpeg 4.4 (check with `ffmpeg -version`).
So if your installed version needs to be updated, you can either install a custom repository
that has the newer version, compile ffmpeg from source or download pre-compiled binaries.
You can then tell AAXtoMP3 to use the compiled binaries with the `--ffmpeg-path` flag.
You need to specify the folder where the ffmpeg and ffprobe binaries are. Make sure
they are both executable.

If you have snapd installed, you can also install a recent version of 4.4 from the edge channel:
```
snap install ffmpeg --edge
```
In this case you will need to configure a custom path _and_ binary name for ffprobe, `--ffmpeg-path /snap/bin/ --ffprobe-name ffmpeg.ffprobe`.

__Fedora__

Fedora users need to enable the rpm fusion repository to install ffmpeg. Version 22 and upwards are currently supported. The following command works independent of your current version:
```
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
```
Afterwards use the package manager to install ffmpeg:
```
sudo dnf install ffmpeg
```

__RHEL or compatible like CentOS__

RHEL version 6 and 7 are currently able to use rpm fusion.
In order to use rpm fusion you have to enable EPEL, see http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL

Add the rpm fusion repositories in version 6
```
sudo yum localinstall --nogpgcheck https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/el/rpmfusion-free-release-6.noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/el/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-6.noarch.rpm
```
or version 7:
```
sudo yum localinstall --nogpgcheck https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/el/rpmfusion-free-release-7.noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/el/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-7.noarch.rpm
```
then install ffmpeg:
```
sudo yum install ffmpeg
```

__MacOS__
```
brew install ffmpeg
brew install gnu-sed
brew install grep
brew install findutils
```

#### mp4art/mp4chaps (part of mp4v2-utils package)
_Note: This is an optional dependency, required for adding cover art to m4a and b4b files only._

__Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian__

Build from https://github.com/enzo1982/mp4v2

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enzo1982/mp4v2
cd mp4v2
./configure && make && sudo make install
```

On Debian and Ubuntu the mp4v2-utils package has been deprecated and removed from the repo, as the upstream project is no longer maintained.The package was removed in Debian Buster, and Ubuntu Focal [ 20.04 ].

__CentOS, RHEL & Fedora__
```
# CentOS/RHEL and Fedora users make sure that you have enabled atrpms repository in system. Letâ€™s begin installing FFmpeg as per your operating system.
yum install mp4v2-utils
```
__MacOS__
```
brew install mp4v2
```

#### mediainfo
_Note: This is an optional dependency._

__Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian__
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mediainfo
```
__CentOS, RHEL & Fedora__
```
yum install mediainfo
```
__MacOS__
```
brew install mediainfo
```
## AAXC files
The AAXC format is a new Audible encryption format, meant to replace the old AAX.
The encryption has been updated, and now to decrypt the file the authcode
is not sufficient, we need two "keys" which are unique for each audiobook.
Since getting those keys is not simple, for now the method used to get them
is handled by the package audible-cli, that stores them in a .voucher file
when downloading the aaxc file. This means that in order to decrypt the
aaxc files, they must be downloaded with audible-cli.

Note that you need at least [ffmpeg 4.4](#ffmpegffprobe).

## Audible-cli integration
Some information is not present in the AAX file--for example, the chapter's
title, additional chapters division (Opening and End credits, Copyright and
more). This information are available via a non-public audible API. This
[repo](https://github.com/mkb79/Audible) provides a python API wrapper, and the
[audible-cli](https://github.com/mkb79/audible-cli) package makes easy to get
more info. In particular the flags **--cover --cover-size 1215 --chapter**
downloads a better-quality cover (.jpg) and detailed chapter info (.json). The
flag **--annotation** downloads a .json file containing your notes and bookmarks.
More info is available on the package page.

Some books might not be available in the old `aax` format, but only in the newer
`aaxc` format. In that case, you can use [audible-cli](https://github.com/mkb79/audible-cli)
to download them. For example, to download all the books in your library in the newer `aaxc` format, as well as
chapter's title and an HQ cover: `audible download --all --aaxc --cover --cover-size 1215 --chapter`.

To make AAXtoMP3 use the additional data, specify the **--use-audible-cli-data**
flag: it expects the cover, chapter, and annotations files (and the voucher, if converting
an aaxc file) to be in the same location of the AAX / AAXC file.  The naming of these
files must be the one set by audible-cli. When converting AAXC files, this flag
is automatically set, so be sure to follow the instructions in this paragraph.

For more information on how to use the `audible-cli` package, check out the git page [audible-cli](https://github.com/mkb79/audible-cli).

Please note that right now audible-cli is in dev stage, so keep in mind that the
naming scheme of the additional files, the flags syntax and other things can
change without warning.

## Cover Art
The script expects a single `.jpg` cover art file in the format `BookTitle_(###).jpg`; however, the highest resolution will be selected if multiple files exist (e.g., `BookTitle_(500).jpg`, `BookTitle_(1215).jpg` picks 1215).

* [Audible-cli Cheat Sheet](audible_cli_cheat_sheet.md): Handy commands for downloading `.aax/.aaxc`, covers, chapters, and annotations.

## Anti-Piracy Notice
Note that this project **does NOT â€˜crackâ€™** the DRM. It simply allows the user to
use their own encryption key (fetched from Audible servers) to decrypt the
audiobook in the same manner that the official audiobook playing software does.

Please only use this application for gaining full access to your own audiobooks
for archiving/conversion/convenience. DeDRMed audiobooks should not be uploaded
to open servers, torrents, or other methods of mass distribution. No help will
be given to people doing such things. Authors, retailers, and publishers all
need to make a living, so that they can continue to produce audiobooks for us to
hear, and enjoy. Donâ€™t be a parasite.

## License
Changed the license to the WTFPL, do whatever you like with this script. Ultimately it's just a front-end for ffmpeg after all.
